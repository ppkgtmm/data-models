# data models

Repo created to store code from Data Models (a.k.a. Data Modeling and Visualization) course CPE 213 taught by King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. Each folder contains lecture code and my answers to lab if any was given for corresponding class

## Walk through
- [lab 2](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L2%20-%20Data%20preparation/Exercise.ipynb) find answers of questions given by preparing flights delay data into suitable form
- [lab 3](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L3%20-%20Data%20visualization/Exercise.ipynb) practice conveying results from data visualization and optionally make suggestions
- [lab 4 & 5](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L4-5%20-%20Distribution%20and%20association%20analysis/Exercise.ipynb) perform distribution analysis (univariate & bivariate) and analyse association between variables
- [lab 6](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L6%20-%20Network%20analysis/Exercise.ipynb) do network manipulation, visualization, descriptive statistics computation and interpretation
- [lab 7](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L7%20-%20Model%20statistical%20distribution/Exercise.ipynb) learn about statistical probability distributions and cummulative probability distribution of data
- [lab 8](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/data-models/blob/main/L8%20-%20Linear%20regression/Exercise.ipynb) explore data, experiment and create linear regression models for daily demand forcasting

## Sample work
- Data visualization

  - Bank faced failure in previous marketing campaign for majority of customers who did not subscribe to term deposit
  - Proportion of customers who did not subscribed but have successful previous marketing campaign outcome is not neglectable especially for customers having age between 18 - 25 and above 55. As an alternative, bank could ask for opinions related to term deposit from these two groups to create personalized offers if possible

- Network analysis
